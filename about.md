java is a known language, developers know it and don't have to learn it

its harder to shoot yourself with java than with c, c++ code since it has no pointer arithmetic

it runs in a vm, so no need to recompile it for every phone out there and easy to secure

large number of developement tools for java (see first)

several mobile phones already used java me, so java was known in the industry

the speed difference is not an issue for most applications, if it were you should code in assembly

java have a large community
